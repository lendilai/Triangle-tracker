# Triangle tracker
#### A project that tracks the type of triangle, Date: 26.04.2019, Version:1.0
#### By **Nathan Ng'ethe**

## Description
This project is aimed at allowing the user to track triangle types as by the dimensions entered. The dimensions are the base, height, and hypotenuse lengths. Furthermore, you can also get the area of the triangle as per the dimensions. The dimensions can be either whole numbers or even decimals.

## Features
* Types of triangles section
* Tracking a triangle by its Dimensions
* Finding the area of a triangle

### Types section
### Tracker
### Area finder

## Setup
The project can be accessed online through the live link in the description. Unfortunately it can not be setup on a computer but you are free to clone it.

## Technologies used
- [HTML & CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) - I used HTML to create the backbone of the project and as well as add images found in the project. CSS was used in styling the HTML document.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap acts as a framework in the development of the project such as in positioning objects.
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - This was used to create the criteria for tracking the triangles as well as putting in the formula that finds the area of a triangle.

## BDD
  |      **Behaviour**       |     **Input example** | **Output example** |
  |  Program should handle: |    What it receives:   |  It should return:  |  
  | :---             |           :---:       |:---        |      
  | None triangles | 0, 0 ,0 | Not a triangle |
  | Equilateral triangles | 5, 5, 5 | This is an equilateral triangle |
  | Isosceles triangles | 5, 5, 4 | This is an isosceles triangle |
  | Scalene triangles | 6, 7, 8 | This is a scalene triangle |
  | Right angled triangles | 3, 4, 5 | This is a right-angled triangle |
  | Area of a triangle | 3, 4, 5 | Area = 6 |
